#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var â€“ it is The old way to make a box for storing stuff. We can change whatâ€™s inside and even make another box with the same name.
let â€“ It is  a newer, smarter box. We can change whatâ€™s inside, but we cannot make another box with the same name in the same place.
const â€“ It is a special box that we cannot change once we  put something in. we must put something in it right away.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

filter() â†’ Goes through each item and keeps only the ones that pass a test, giving a new array.
